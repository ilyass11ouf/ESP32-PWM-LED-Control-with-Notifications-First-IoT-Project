# ESP32 PWM LED Control with Notifications – First IoT Project

## Overview
This is my **first practical ESP32 project**, designed to control the built-in LED remotely.  
It allows:
- ON / OFF control
- Brightness adjustment via slider
- Real-time notifications on LED state changes  

This project documents the **start of my embedded systems and IoT journey**.

## Hardware
- ESP32 Dev Module
- Built-in LED (GPIO 2)
- WiFi connection

## Features
- Button widget (V0) → LED ON/OFF
- Slider widget (V1) → Brightness 0–255
- Real-time notifications via Blynk
- Hardware PWM using LEDC

## Roadmap
- v1.0: Foundations ✅
- v2.0: Code cleanup & debug
- v3.0: Persistence & reliability
- v4.0: Local web interface
- v5.0: Multiple outputs & sensors
